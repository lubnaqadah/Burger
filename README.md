# Burger
***

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured, and save it in the sql database.

The App was developed using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM following the MVC design pattern, I used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
